### Q2: Multiplication Table Generator
Write a Python program that asks the user for a number and prints its multiplication table up to 10.

```
Sample Input:
Enter a number: 7  

Sample Output:
7 x 1 = 7  
7 x 2 = 14  
7 x 3 = 21  
...  
7 x 10 = 70  

```

### Q3: Guess the Number Game
Create a simple number guessing game. The computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the player has to guess it. After each guess, the program should indicate whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.

```
Sample Input:
Guess the number: 45  

Sample Output:
Too low! Try again.  
(Game continues until the correct number is guessed.)

```

### Q4: Rock, Paper, Scissors Game
Write a Python program to let the user play "Rock, Paper, Scissors" against the computer. The computer randomly selects one of the three choices. The program should determine the winner based on the rules of the game.

```
Sample Input:
Enter your choice (rock, paper, scissors): rock  

Sample Output:
Computer chose scissors.

```

### Q5: Password Strength Checker

Be at least 8 characters long

Contain at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one number

```
