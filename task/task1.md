### Q2: Multiplication Table Generator
Write a Python program that asks the user for a number and prints its multiplication table up to 10.

```
Sample Input:
Enter a number: 7  

Sample Output:
7 x 1 = 7  
7 x 2 = 14  
7 x 3 = 21  
...  
7 x 10 = 70  

```

### Q3: Guess the Number Game
Create a simple number guessing game. The computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the player has to guess it. After each guess, the program should indicate whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.

```
Sample Input:
Guess the number: 45  

Sample Output:
Too low! Try again.  
(Game continues until the correct number is guessed.)

```

### Q4: Rock, Paper, Scissors Game
Write a Python program to let the user play "Rock, Paper, Scissors" against the computer. The computer randomly selects one of the three choices. The program should determine the winner based on the rules of the game.

```

Be at least 8 characters long

Contain at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one number

```
Sample Input:
Enter a password: Hello123  

Sample Output:
Password is strong. 
```

## After this everything should be solved using function (6 - 10)

### Q6: Shopping Cart System
Create a simple shopping cart system where the user can add items and their prices. After the user is done, display the total bill.

```
Sample Input:
Enter item name: Apple  
Enter item price: 2  
Do you want to add more items? (yes/no): yes

```

### Q8: Dice Rolling Simulator
Write a Python program that simulates rolling a dice. When the user presses enter, it should generate a random number between 1 and 6.

```
Sample Output:

Rolling the dice...  
You got a 5! ðŸŽ²  

```

### Q9: Word Guessing Game
Create a game where the computer picks a random word from a list, and the player has to guess it by entering letters one at a time. If the letter is in the word, it reveals its position(s).

```
Sample Input:
Guess a letter: e  

Sample Output:
Correct! The word so far: _ e _ _ _  

```

### Q10: Temperature Converter
Write a Python program that allows the user to convert temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit.

```
Sample Input:
Enter temperature: 100  
Convert to (C/F): C  

Sample Output:
Converted temperature: 37.78Â°C  
```
